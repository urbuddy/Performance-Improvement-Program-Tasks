# Performance-Improvement-Program-Tasks

In this program there is a four tasks to complete are as follows:
    
    1. Create end-to-end UI automation scripts(at least 3) with puppeteer-jest, scripts should have multiple methods/operations.

    Expectations:
        ● Should be different from each other and exclude the scenarios which are already
        covered.
        ● Strictly follow the page object model.
        ● Methods should be dynamic and re-usable(if they can be used for achieving the same
        goal but on different pages/cases).
        ● Selectors should be dynamic(If the same selector can be used for multiple elements by
        replacing some value, avoid using static numbers in selectors e.g. [#label]:nth-child(2)).
        ● Implement assertions wherever necessary, assertions should reflect the validation of the
        steps performed.
        ● No use of hardcoded timeout/wait.
        ● No flakiness

    Result: Here I created three different scripts with all expectations, Those three scripts are  follows:
        I.   XYZ Bank Web-Site Automation.
        II.  Swag Labs Site Automation.
        III. Pet Store Site Automation.

    2. Learn about API methods and libraries which can be used to perform http requests and operations(like superagent, axios)
    Expectations:
        ● Create some scenarios to test out API requests(use https://reqres.in/)
        ● Use http methods like POST, GET , PUT , DELETE, PATCH and create test scripts
        using these methods.
        ● Implement assertions to validate the response.
        ● Create methods to make http calls(which will accept data required to make http calls)
        and use those methods in test scripts.

    Result: Here I created a API test script with all expectations, The script name is:
        ● Reqres API Automation.

    3. Learn about git and its basic commands
    Expectations:
        ● Should have knowledge of basic commands and how to execute them.
        ● Create a separate repository and push all the tasks into that repository.
        ● All the code pushed in the repository should be clean and ready for review(like there
        should be no commented lines, no console logs, etc).
    
    Result: Here I created a Performance-Improvement-Program-Tasks Repository and upload all the tasks in that Repository.

    4. Learn about JSDocs and how to use them
    Expectations:
        ● Use JSdocs in UI automation methods and also in API methods.

    Result: Here I applies JSDoc Comments in Every method of Each and Every Script of all tasks.
